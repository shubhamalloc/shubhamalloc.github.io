I first wrote code at 16 and proceeded to make that my whole personality (I am a _computer craftsman_). I enjoy making computers do my bidding and shipping something from scratch/iterating on prototypes.

I am a 20yo, CS + Math undergrad at [Ahmedabad Uni](https://ahduni.edu.in) and interested in a variety of things, including computer science, math (no way you saw these two coming), internet businesses, running, tennis and fleetingly in a thousand different things.

I am open to work across domains and can work on web-apps, biz logic.
